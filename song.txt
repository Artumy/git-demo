Full of despair inside a darkness
Self conscious and scared, held prisoner of war
Running out of air, buried in a sadness
Want a way out of this paralyzing world
And the sound of the cries when a family's loved one dies
It echoes through a vacant room where a young soul still resides

When the night is cold and you feel like no-one knows
what it's like to be the only one buried in this hole
You can make it to the sunrise.
You can make it to the sunrise.
